    Generation based Applications in NLP
</h1>

There are many generation based problems in NLP like language modelling, machine translation, text summarization, sequence to sequence problems like NER, POS tagging, Image Captioning, and many others. Here I will be exploring a few of the applications.

**Note: Please raise an issue for any suggestions, corrections, and feedback.**

# Language Modeling

What is a Language Model in NLP? Language modeling is central to many important natural language processing tasks. A language model learns to predict the probability of a sequence of words.

## Generating Names.ipynb

Given a starting character, generate a name starting with that character. 

We’ll train LSTM character-level language models. That is, we’ll give the LSTM a huge chunk of names and ask it to model the probability distribution of the next character in the sequence given a sequence of previous characters. This will then allow us to generate new name one character at a time.

# Machine Translation

Machine Translation (MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language. Ideally, a source language sequence is translated into target language sequence. 

## Basic Machine Translation.ipynb

The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are encoder-decoder models, which commonly use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a context vector. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then decoded by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.

## Improved Machine Translation.ipynb

After trying the basic machine translation which has text perplexity `36.68`, following techniques have been experimented and a test perplexity `7.041`.

- GRU is used instead of LSTM
- Single layer
- Context vector is sent to decoder rnn along with decoder input embedding
- Context vector is sent to classifier along with the decoder hidden state

## Machine Translation with Bahdanau Attention.ipynb

The attention mechanism was born to help memorize long source sentences in neural machine translation (NMT). Rather than building a single context vector out of the encoder's last hidden state, attention is used to focus more on the relevant parts of the input while decoding a sentence. The context vector will be created by taking encoder outputs and the `previous hidden state` of the decoder rnn.

## Masking, Packing, Visualization, BLEU on MT.ipynb

Enhancements like masking (ignoring the attention over padded input), packing padded sequences (for better computation), attention visualization and BLEU metric on test data are implemented.

## Machine Translation with Transformer.ipynb

The Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output is used to do Machine translation from German to English. A test perplexity of `5.677` was achieved with even lesser training time.

# Utterance Generation

Utterance generation is an important problem in NLP, especially in question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, conversation systems, to name a few. It could also be used to create synthentic training data for many NLP problems.

## Basic Utterance Generation.ipynb

The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are encoder-decoder models, which commonly use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a context vector. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then decoded by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time. A two-layer LSTM was used.

## Utterance Generation with Attention.ipynb

The attention mechanism will help in memorizing long sentences. Rather than building a single context vector out of the encoder's last hidden state, attention is used to focus more on the relevant parts of the input while decoding a sentence. The context vector will be created by taking encoder outputs and the `hidden state` of the decoder rnn.

After trying the basic LSTM apporach, Utterance generation with attention mechanism was implemented. Inference (run time generation) was also implemented.

## Utterance Generation with Basic Beam Search.ipynb

One of the ways to mitigate the repetition in the generation of utterances is to use Beam Search. By choosing the top-scored word at each step (greedy) may lead to a sub-optimal solution but by choosing a lower scored word that may reach an optimal solution.

Instead of greedily choosing the most likely next step as the sequence is constructed, the beam search expands all possible next steps and keeps the k most likely, where k is a user-specified parameter and controls the number of beams or parallel searches through the sequence of probabilities.

## Utterance Generation with Coverage.ipynb

Repetition is a common problem for sequenceto-sequence models, and is especially pronounced when generating a multi-sentence text. In coverage model, we maintain a
coverage vector `c^t`, which is the sum of attention distributions over all previous decoder timesteps

This ensures that the attention mechanism’s current decision (choosing where to attend next) is informed by a reminder of its previous decisions (summarized in c^t). This should make it easier for the attention mechanism to avoid repeatedly attending to the same locations, and thus avoid generating repetitive text.

## Utterance Generation with Transformer.ipynb

The Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output is used to do generate utterance from a given sentence. The training time was also lot faster `4x` times compared to RNN based architecture. Beam search was also improved.

## Utterance Generation with BPE Tokenization.ipynb

Today, subword tokenization schemes inspired by BPE have become the norm in most advanced models including the very popular family of contextual language models like BERT, GPT-2,RoBERTa, etc.

BPE brings the perfect balance between character and word-level hybrid representations which makes it capable of managing large corpora. This behavior also enables the encoding of any rare words in the vocabulary with appropriate subword tokens without introducing any “unknown” tokens.

Utterance generation using BPE tokenization instead of Spacy is implemented.
